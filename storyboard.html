    Storyboarding really helped me figure out what the goals of my project are, even if I know yet know what the project will be.  My first iteration shows a hearing-abled person being curious about ASL and then going online to learn about it and practice it.  In the final scene he is able to communicatie with a person from the deaf community.  In my second iteration, I wanted to show how ASL can benefit everyone, whether you are hearing-abled or not.  For example, communicating from across a room, at a noisy bar or with your infant can all be improved with knowledge of ASL.  The guy in the storyboard then starts learning ASL in a way that doesn't disrupt his routine very much but is still effective.  In the final scene, he is able to communicate with a wide variety of people in various different situations.
