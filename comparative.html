    <h2>Diversity and Design</h2>
    <p>
      After brainstorming possible ideas for a project centered around <em>diversity in design</em>, I realized that I want my project to focus on inclusive and universal design.  As technology becomes more and more available to people around the world, developers are faced with a challenge; making their technology accessible and inclusive for all.  I came across an article on the San Francisco Design Week blog titled <a href="https://2018.sfdesignweek.org/how-to-infuse-diversity-and-inclusion-in-design">How to infuse diversity and inclusion in design</a>.

        The article details an interview with Fabricio Teixeira, a designer and author who specializes in experience design that is inclusive and diverse.  When asked about the subject, one of the main benchmarks that Teixeira brings up as crucial for inclusive design is having diverse teams. "Lack of diversity makes it more challenging for a creative lead to ensure the team is exploring multiple, varied solutions and angles on how to tackle the same problem" says Teixeira.  As co-founder of <a href=" https://uxdesign.cc">uxdesign.cc</a>, Diversity Month was a major initiative for the online UX publication last April. They posted stories shared by the community about people's own experiences and personal take on diversity in design.  <br />One major takeaway surrounds the idea of creating equal opportunities for people of diverse backgrounds so that a particular industry can flourish while being mindful that diversity is still underrepresented in college graduates.  The interface of the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/diversity-and-design/home">Diversity Month</a> webpage was clean and simple.  Usability was clear and obvious, however, the large gradient rectangle graphics were a bit confusing.  It was unclear if there was a problem loading the page because that space seemed like it would be showing a photo.  I would say that the design choice to have large colored rectangles as article links was not well executed.  The website was easy to use on mobile and desktop displays, and it was responsive so as to optimize layout based on the size of the web browser.

    <h2>Universal Design</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to researching diversity in design, I wanted to learn more about universal design and how to implement inclusivity into the actual design process.  I decided to start at the website for the <a href="http://universaldesign.ie/Home/">Centre for Excellence in Universal Design</a>.  This is an organization that was established by Ireland's National Disability Authority (NDA).  Their purpose is to advocate for universal access for all of Ireland's citizens so that a people can get the most out of a given experience or environment.  They focus on developing and perpetuating universal design standards as well as promoting education and awareness about universal design.  The major areas of focus for the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design are on the public built environment, technology, and products & services.<br />
      The hierarchy of the header and navigation bars is somewhat successful.  I would say that it needs some sort of reconfiguration so that that usability is more clear and obvious.  As you can see on the left, there are three horizontal navigation bars, some of them having the same links, so this is a bit confusing.  This website has an extended, "double-decker" footer which essentially holds a link to every single page on the site.  I found this to be a lot at first, but it did allow me to browse titles of the information that was available without having to toggle over a rollout navigation bar.  Another interesting observation while exploring this website is that when hovering over almost any clickable element, an orange box appeared that would surround the clickable area.  You can see an example of this on the left.  If you click the magnifying glass without having entered anything in the search bar, the orange box appears as well as a prompt saying, "Fill out this field".  I think this has something to do with accessible screen readers or navigators, but this an area that I would have to research more.
