  <h2>Audience Test Results</h2>

<p>
  During the user testing session I preented my working prototype to two users I hadn't met before.  Each round began with 5 minutes of the user navigating my site with no talking or explanation from me.  This was really helpful to witness because it allwed me to see what others pick up on that I hadn't.  The user testing was beneficial because the two people who used my prototype picked up on different improvements that could be made.  Here are the major takeaways:
</p>
<ul class="objectives">
  <li>Slow down the speed of the fingerspelling game</li>
  <li>Show a progress visual that lets users know where they are in the site</li>
  <li>Position the canvas in the first module so the user doesn't have to move their hand</li>
  <li>Have an objective or goal for each game so that users don't just keep playing forever</li>
  <li>Give the games more fun and playful names</li>
</ul>
