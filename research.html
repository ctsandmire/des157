<h2>Background research</h2>

<p>
  When looking into designing something with the driving concept being diversity, I was interested in universal design that is inclusive for people of varying ability levels.  American Sign Language (ASL) has always fascinated me.  My mom is a speech and language pathologist and used to practice ASL when I was growing up.  She needed to know how to sign so she could communicate with children who had speech difficulty.<br />
  As you can imagine, the way that spoken language is constructed varies greatly regionally so it makes sense that sign languages are different in countries where different languages are spoken.  According to the National Institute of Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, there are many variations of sign languages across the globe and they provide researchers the ability to understand how this type of communication develops and how it is learned.  For example, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language (ABSL) was developed in a small Israeli community over the past 75 years.  Researchers are interested in studying ABSL because it is rather new and is used by verbal and non-verbal community members.<br />
  Something that is problematic about learning sign language through media is that it is difficult to fully grasp a sign's motion aspect from a still image.  In the past, you would have to learn through a tutor with only supplemental support from image references.  The internet certainly helps improve the learning process for those who are interested because it allows a wide variety of media to be shared.<br />
  Moving images are critical for learning ASL.  The picture below shows how to sign for "no" (The Odyssey Online).  Two still images are used in order to show the motion that the sign requires in order to correctly communicate its meaning.  It is difficult to distinguish the subtle movement that the two images are trying to highlight and therefore it does not easily facilitate learning.  Elsewhere on the web, gifs and videos are used, which I believe are more successful.<br />
  As I am researching, I am learning that ASL is not just for the deaf community.  It is a useful form of communication that anyone can take advantage of.  According to American Sign Language University, learning to sign helps your brain and can even let you communicate with your baby before he or she has developed spoken language.  ASL also isn't just signing with your hands.  "ASL has its own grammar, culture, history, terminology and other unique characteristics" (ASLU).  With ASL, facial expressions, body language, and other subtleties are used to convey meaning just like how tone and vocal inflections are used in spoken language.
